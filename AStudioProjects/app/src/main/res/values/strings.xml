    <string name="FreeFall_Explanation">Everything on Earth is under the affect of gravity.
        Normally if you hold a ball up in the air you are forcing it to have zero acceleration, but gravity will cause it to accelerate as soon as you release it.\n\n
        Before taking data consider the following: \n
        For this experiment the MotionBall will measure the acceleration of the ball and calculate speed and position, so hold it up high, then collect data and then drop the ball. Compare the graphs you see to what you answered above.\n\n
        You can also hit "view table" to see points on the graph and do some math.

    <string name="FreeFall_Questions">
        What would you expect a graph of acceleration vs time to look like?\n
        What would you expect a graph of speed vs time to look like?\n
        What would you expect a graph of position vs time to look like?\n\n
        Compare the graphs you see to what you answered above.\n\n
